    <p class = "about-text">  Hello, I am a junior majoring in Software Engineering at the University of California, Irvine.  I am passionate about web development
      and want to learn more about creating interactive applications that focus on great user experiences.  I am currently familiar with CSS, 
      HTML, Javascript (ES6), C++ and Java. <br><br> Constantly seeking opportunites to learn new concepts and technologies and of course, improve on existing ones.
      I eventually want to become a full time Full-Stack developer but in the meantime, am very excited to join a team as an intern.  <br><br> 
      Outside of programming, I'm an avid basketball fan, cat connoisseur and a fitness trainer.  Whether you want helpful fitness tips 
      or to engage in basketball debates, let's connect!  </p>
